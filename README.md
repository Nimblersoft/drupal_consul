# Drupal Consul

An open citizenship participation platform built as a Drupal distribution.

This project has been greatly inspired in the Ruby based application Consul. This has been implemented as an alternative that can be easily integrated with Drupal contributed modules and PHP based libraries through composer, as well as to leverage the inherent SOA of Drupal.
