# Drupal Consul

An open citizenship participation platform built as a Drupal distribution.

This project has been greatly inspired in the Ruby based application Consul. This has been implemented as an alternative that can be easily integrated with Drupal contributed modules and PHP based libraries through composer, as well as to leverage the inherent SOA of Drupal.

## Installing Drupal Consul
The preferred way to install Lightning is using our
[Composer-based project template][template]. It's easy!

```
$ composer self-update
$ composer create-project nimblersoft/drupal-consul-project MY_PROJECT
```

If you don't want to use Composer, you can install Drupal Consul the traditional way
by downloading a tarball from our
[drupal.org project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal_consul).
