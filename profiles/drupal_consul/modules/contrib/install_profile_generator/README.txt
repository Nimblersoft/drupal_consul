Install Profile Generator

This module provides a drush command to create an install profile from a site's active configuration.

How to use:

* Install the module
* Run drush install-profile-generate --name=test to generate an install profile with a sync-able config directory.

If you apply the core patch on https://www.drupal.org/node/2788777 you'll be able to install a site using the new profile.
